# Variable increment; Search

In this lesson we add the semantics of variable increment. We also learn
how to instruct the `kompile` tool to instrument the language model for
exhaustive analysis.

The variable increment rule is self-explanatory:

    rule <k> ++X => I +Int 1 ...</k>
         <env>... X |-> N ...</env>
         <store>... N |-> (I => I +Int 1) ...</store>

We can now run programs like our `div.imp` program introduced in Lesson 1.
Do it.

The addition of increment makes the evaluation of expressions have side
effects. That, in combination with the non-determinism allowed by the
strictness attributes in how expression constructs evaluate their
arguments, makes expressions in particular and programs in general have
non-deterministic behaviors. One possible execution of the `div.imp` program
assigns `1` to `y`'s location, for example, but this program manifests several
other behaviors, too.

To see all the (final-state) behaviors that a program can have, you can kompile
the semantics with `--enable-search` and call the `krun` tool with the option
`--search`. For example:

    krun div.imp --search

In the next lesson we add input/output to our language and learn how to
generate a model of it which behaves like an interactive interpreter!
